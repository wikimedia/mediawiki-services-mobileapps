Is there any possibility, to indicate that? If not, it should be programmed, because it opens new possibilities, e.g. mouse-ever effects when having the mouse pointer over a sentence. Then, a pop-up box could show \"Miller (2009), p. 7\". Furthermore, it is much more helpful for future editors to know, if sentence 1 has a reference already and can be relied on.

Given that I mostly use modern and occasionally mono, would it be possible to be able to add the quickbar option for modern so the navigation bar can be moved to the right hand side. I think you should give people this option for all skins givne that some people are left handed and might find it more natural to have it on the otherside. I also think there should be a shrinkable option on the nav bars like we have with big templates for instance as if we could conveniently shrink the task while reading or at least have the option to this would ease useability I think. Also for the task bar on modern does it have to be so wide?

This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community<a href=\"./Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_82#Learn_to_be_a_Wikipedia_Administrator_-_New_class_at_MSU\" title=\"Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 82\">HERE</a>, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.<br><br>So a few things about the interviews:<ul><li>Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.</li><li>Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)</li><li>All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.</li><li>All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.</li><li>The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.</li></ul>Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name<a href=\"./User:Jaobar/Admins_to_Interview_List_1\" title=\"User:Jaobar/Admins to Interview List 1\">HERE</a> instead.<br><br>If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu.

          "html": "Just had a thought. Sometimes you want to quickly identify the status of something in a process - say, the completion amount of a particular day at AFD. So you go to that page's AFD log and there's a great big table of contents. Short of scrolling down the page there's no way to know what the status is of each item in that TOC. My suggestion: a magic word that allows the appending of text to the display of a heading in a TOC. Something like this:<br><br>== First thing {{TOCLABEL:closed}}==<br>Text<br>== Second thing {{TOCLABEL:open}}==<br>Text<br>== Third thing {{TOCLABEL:reopened}}==<br>Text<br><br>which would render something like:<br><br>Contents <a href=\"./User_talk:Brion_VIBBER\">(hide)</a>"

          "html": "Dear Brion VIBBER,<br><br>I am cross-posting this message to many places to make sure everyone who is a Wikimedia Foundation project bureaucrat receives a copy. If you are a bureaucrat on more than one wiki, you will receive this message on each wiki where you are a bureaucrat.<br><br>As you may have seen, work to perform the Wikimedia cluster-wide <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/SUL%20finalisation\" title=\"mw:SUL finalisation\">single-user login finalisation</a> (SUL finalisation) is taking place. This may potentially effect your work as a local bureaucrat, so please read this message carefully.<br><br>Why is this happening? As currently stated at <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Global%20rename%20policy\" title=\"m:Global rename policy\">the global rename policy</a>, a global account is a name linked to a single user across all Wikimedia wikis, with local accounts unified into a global collection. Previously, the only way to rename a unified user was to individually rename every local account. This was an extremely difficult and time-consuming task, both for stewards and for the users who had to initiate discussions with local bureaucrats (who perform local renames to date) on every wiki with available bureaucrats. The process took a very long time, since it's difficult to coordinate crosswiki renames among the projects and bureaucrats involved in individual projects.<br><br>The SUL finalisation will be taking place in stages, and one of the first stages will be to turn off Special:RenameUser locally. This needs to be done as soon as possible, on advice and input from Stewards and engineers for the project, so that no more accounts that are unified globally are broken by a local rename to usurp the global account name. Once this is done, the process of global name unification can begin. The date that has been chosen to turn off local renaming and shift over to entirely global renaming is 15 September 2014, or three weeks time from now. In place of local renames is a new tool, hosted on Meta, that allows for global renames on all wikis where the name is not registered will be deployed.<br><br>Your help is greatly needed during this process and going forward in the future if, as a bureaucrat, renaming users is something that you do or have an interest in participating in. The Wikimedia Stewards have set up, and are in charge of, a new community usergroup on Meta in order to share knowledge and work together on renaming accounts globally, called <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Global%20renamers\" title=\"m:Global renamers\">Global renamers</a>. Stewards are in the process of creating documentation to help global renamers to get used to and learn more about global accounts and tools and Meta in general as well as the application format. As transparency is a valuable thing in our movement, the Stewards would like to have at least a brief public application period. If you are an experienced renamer as a local bureaucrat, the process of becoming a part of this group could take as little as 24 hours to complete. You, as a bureaucrat, should be able to apply for the global renamer right on Meta by the <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/SRGP\" title=\"m:SRGP\">requests for global permissions</a> page on 1 September, a week from now.<br><br>In the meantime please update your local page where users request renames to reflect this move to global renaming, and if there is a rename request and the user has edited more than one wiki with the name, please send them to <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/SRUC\" title=\"m:SRUC\">the request page for a global rename</a>.<br><br>Stewards greatly appreciate the trust local communities have in you and want to make this transition as easy as possible so that the two groups can start working together to ensure everyone has a unique login identity across Wikimedia projects. Completing this project will allow for long-desired universal tools like a global watchlist, global notifications and many, many more features to make work easier.<br><br>If you have any questions, comments or concerns about the SUL finalisation, read over the <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/SUL\" title=\"m:SUL\">Help:Unified login</a> page on Meta and leave a note on the talk page there, or on the talk page for <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Global%20renamers\" title=\"m:Talk:Global renamers\">global renamers</a>. You can also contact me on <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User%20talk:Keegan%20(WMF)\" title=\"m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)\">my talk page on meta</a> if you would like. I'm working as a bridge between Wikimedia Foundation Engineering and Product Development, Wikimedia Stewards, and you to assure that SUL finalisation goes as smoothly as possible; this is a community-driven process and I encourage you to work with the Stewards for our communities.<br><br>Thank you for your time.<br>-- <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Keegan%20(WMF)\" title=\"m:User:Keegan (WMF)\">Keegan (WMF)</a> <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User%20talk:Keegan%20(WMF)\" title=\"m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)\">talk</a> 18:24, 25 August 2014 (UTC)"
