      summary: Get page content HTML optimized for mobile consumption
      description: |
        Gets the content HTML optimized for mobile consumption for the given page. This content
        is derived from Parsoid HTML (see `/page/html/{title}` endpoint).
        The difference to Parsoid HTML is roughly:
        * Some elements and attributes not needed for the reading case are removed.
        * LeadIntroductionTransform: The introductory paragraph is moved before an infobox.
        * RedLinks: Red links are flattened (=turned into span elements).
        * WidenImage: images that should be displayed in gallery are widened.
        * Section headings are slightly changed by wrapping the headings inside a div and adding
          a span element inside the new div for the edit buttons.
        * Additional classes are added to img elements to fix issues with non-white backgrounds.
          See Theme support below for instructions on how to enable that.
        * Pagelib CSS files needed to display the content are referenced.
        * LazyLoadTransform: server-side portion/prep for lazy loading of images.
